# Contributing to Pubsub-Plus-Emulator

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

* Fork the repo.

* Run tests and ensure you have a clean slate before raising a pull request (PR)

* Add test cases for your changes. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need a test

* Update the documentation

* Push your changes to the forked repository and submit a pull request.

And in case we didn't emphasize it enough: we love tests!
